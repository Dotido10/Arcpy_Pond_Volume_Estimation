Storm water retention basin volume estimation.
To compute the basin's water volume, we will use a USGS DEM as the primary dataset, since it provides elevation data for the entire basin surface and also a shapefile representing the water footprint in the basin.
The storm water retention basin is a sink. By filling it at the level of the water footprint, and then comparing the filled elevation to the basin's original elevation, we can determine the volume capacity.
